    rev: v1.13.0
    hooks:
    - id: mypy
      additional_dependencies: [types-seaborn, polars, pandas]
      args: ["--ignore-missing-imports", "--strict"]

     # pre-commit runs each hook in an isolated environment,
     # which doesnâ€™t automatically include the main project dependencies.
     # When running mypy through pre-commit, any libraries you use in your project
     # (like pandas, polars, etc.) need to be explicitly installed in this isolated environment.
     # By listing these libraries in additional_dependencies, you ensure that
     # mypy has access to them during the type-checking process.
     # Without them, mypy would raise errors for missing imports.
